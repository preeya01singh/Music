Learning to read piano sheet music is like learning a new language — with time and practice, you'll become fluent. Here’s a structured guide to help you get started:

---

## 🎼 1. Understand the Staff

A **staff** consists of **five lines and four spaces** where notes are placed. Each line and space represents a musical pitch.

* **Grand Staff**: Piano music uses two staves joined together:

  * **Treble Clef (G Clef)** – right hand (higher notes)
  * **Bass Clef (F Clef)** – left hand (lower notes)

---

## 🎹 2. Learn the Notes on the Staff

### 🎵 Treble Clef (Right Hand)

* **Lines**: E - G - B - D - F
  *(Mnemonic: Every Good Boy Does Fine)*
* **Spaces**: F - A - C - E
  *(Spells the word FACE)*

### 🎵 Bass Clef (Left Hand)

* **Lines**: G - B - D - F - A
  *(Good Boys Do Fine Always)*
* **Spaces**: A - C - E - G
  *(All Cows Eat Grass)*

---

## 🎯 3. Match Notes to Piano Keys

Start with **Middle C** — the note that connects both clefs.

* Find **Middle C** on the keyboard.
* Learn the pattern of white keys: **A-B-C-D-E-F-G**, repeating upward or downward.
* The black keys are grouped in twos and threes, helping you find white keys.

## ⏱️ 4. Understand Rhythm and Note Values

Each note has a **shape** that tells you how long to hold it:

| Note         | Symbol           | Beats |
| ------------ | ---------------- | ----- |
| Whole note   | ○                | 4     |
| Half note    | ◑                | 2     |
| Quarter note | ●                | 1     |
| Eighth note  | ♪                | ½     |
| Sixteenth    | ♬ or double flag | ¼     |

Also learn **rests**, which are symbols for silence.

---

## 🎶 5. Learn Time Signatures

At the beginning of sheet music, you’ll see something like **4/4**, **3/4**, or **6/8**:

* **Top number** = how many beats per measure
* **Bottom number** = what kind of note gets one beat
  (4 = quarter note, 8 = eighth note, etc.)

---

## 🎼 6. Key Signatures and Accidentals

* **Key Signature**: Sharps (#) or flats (♭) shown after the clef tell you which notes are altered throughout the piece.
* **Accidentals**: Sharps (♯), flats (♭), or naturals (♮) that appear within a measure affect the note for that measure only.

---

## 📐 7. Practice Reading Simple Pieces

Start with beginner sheet music or method books like:

* **"Alfred's Basic Piano Library"**
* **"John Thompson’s Easiest Piano Course"**
* **Free sheet music from musescore.com or 8notes.com**

Begin by **clapping rhythms**, **saying note names aloud**, and then playing slowly.

---

## 🎯 Tips to Progress Faster

* Learn to **sight-read**: Practice reading new pieces slowly, without stopping.
* Use **flashcards** or apps like *Tenuto* or *Simply Piano*.
* Practice **scales** and **chords** to reinforce note locations.

---

## 🎁 Bonus: Quick Reference Diagram

```
Treble Clef: E-G-B-D-F (lines), F-A-C-E (spaces)
Bass Clef: G-B-D-F-A (lines), A-C-E-G (spaces)

Middle C = both clefs connect here
```
