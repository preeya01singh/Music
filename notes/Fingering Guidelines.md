### ðŸŽ¯ General Fingering Guidelines

* **Each finger has a number**:

  * Thumb = 1
  * Index = 2
  * Middle = 3
  * Ring = 4
  * Pinky = 5

* **Scales**: Follow standard fingering (e.g., for C major scale: Right hand = 1-2-3-1-2-3-4-5, Left hand = 5-4-3-2-1-3-2-1).

* **Chords**: Use fingering that allows a relaxed hand shape and easy transitions.

* **Passages**: Plan fingering in advance to avoid awkward stretches or jumps.
